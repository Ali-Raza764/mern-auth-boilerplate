# MERN Authentication Project ðŸ”’

A full-featured authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with additional tools like JWT for token-based authentication, Resend for email verification, Zustand for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, sign-in, and logout functionality.
- **Account Verification**: Users receive an email with a verification code using **Resend**. Accounts must be verified before accessing protected routes.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens ensure secure and stateless authentication.
- **Responsive UI**: The front-end is built with **Vite**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** for a fast and responsive design.
- **State Management**: **Zustand** handles global state management across the app.
- **Icons**: Integrated icons enhance the user-friendly interface.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React (Vite)** for fast development.
- **Tailwind CSS** for sleek, responsive styling.
- **Zustand** for managing global state.
- **React Router** for routing between pages.

### Backend:
- **Node.js & Express** for the server-side.
- **MongoDB** for database storage.
- **JWT** for secure, token-based authentication.
- **Resend** for sending account verification emails.
